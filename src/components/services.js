                                                Mutual, a Fortune 75 firm with more than 280 Scrum
                                                Teams in the US.

                                                <br /><br />Scrum is a skill that requires a lifetime to acquire, according to Ken Schwaber. We can offer Scrum Foundations training
                                                to all of your Scrum Teams and management. In addition, we are authorised to offer your Scrum Masters extra training and
                                                mentoring after they get the widely accepted Professional Scrum Master (PSM) I certification. Regardless of where in the
                                                globe you attend a Scrum.org course, we utilise the same resources, case studies, and instructional strategies because
                                                our training materials are uniform. Indeed, we will never need your staff to pay an annual certification renewal
                                                fee—that is, unlike other training providers, it is a one-time payment!

                                                <br /><br />Since no two firms are the same and have the same needs, we don't believe in a big bang, waterfall approach to
                                                revolution. Our assistance will be in creating a personalised transformation strategy, rather than pushing you to
                                                embrace a trendy term like the "Spotify model." Our scientific approach to transformation can help you succeed. Working
                                                under your direction, we will use Scrum to assemble an enablement team and recommend executing one-week sprints from a
                                                product backlog.
